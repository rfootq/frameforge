# FrameForge

Frameforge is a FreeCAD workbench that aids in designing beams and frames, with cut, mitter joins and so on.

## Prerequisite

- FreeCAD ≥ v0.21.x

## Installation

Frameforge workbench can be installed via the [Addon Manager](https://wiki.freecad.org/Std_AddonMgr)

## Quick Start

### Create the skeleton

Beams are mapped onto Edges or ParametricLine (from a Sketch for instance)

For a start, we are going to create a simple frame.

1. In a new file, switch to the Frameforge workbench.
2. Create a [sketch](https://wiki.freecad.org/Sketcher_NewSketch)  
3. A dialog will open asking you to 'Select orientation'. Choose the XY for instance.
3. Draw a simple square in the sketch... this will be our skeleton

5. Close the Sketch edit mode.

### Create the frame

1. Launch the FrameForge Profile tool

2. It opens a FrameForge dialog (with options)

3. Select a profile from the lists (Material / Family / Size).  
*Note*: Size can be adjusted just below the family, the tool has a lot of predefined profiles. Same for parameters.

4. In the 3D View, select edges to apply the profile creation:

5. Press OK in the Create Profile Task.  
**Result**: now there are four profiles!

**Voila!** You have your first frame! For more information, follow the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
